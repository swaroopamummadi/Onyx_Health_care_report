### overview
   I've been given access to a dataset of 55,500 unique patient records from 10 major hospitals across the U.S. The dataset captures a broad view of hospital admissions, medical conditions, medications, insurance providers, and treatment costs. The goal is to uncover insights that can drive better healthcare decisions, optimize costs, and improve patient outcomes. Create a compelling Power BI dashboard that tells the story of patient care across hospitals, identifies trends, and helps stakeholders make data-informed decisions.
